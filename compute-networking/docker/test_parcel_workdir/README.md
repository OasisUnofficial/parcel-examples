# Simulated Parcel Compute environment

This directory emulates the `/parcel` directory that Parcel will set up and
populate with input documents. It is intended for quick local testing and
iteration, without the involvement of Parcel.

See the [_Complex Compute Jobs_](https://docs.oasislabs.com/parcel/latest/selected-topics/compute-advanced.html) Parcel tutorial on for more info on using
Docker images with Parcel.
